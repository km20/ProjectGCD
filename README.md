Overview
===========
This repo contains the R code used to transform the initial data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset", available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and described [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), into a tidy dataset containing measurments on means and standard deviation of each measurement.

This repo contains the folowing files :
* This file (README.md) describing how the script works.  
* The R script file run_analysis.R which implements the required transformation on the original data set.
* The code book which describes the variables.
